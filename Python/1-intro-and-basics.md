## What is Python?

**Versatile Language**:

- Web development (server-side)
- Software development
- Mathematics
- System scripting

**Cross-Platform**:

- Compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.

**Applications**:

- Create web applications on a server
- Connect to and modify database systems
- Handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Rapid prototyping and production-ready development

## Key Features

**Simple Syntax**:

- Similar to English, which enhances readability
- Write programs with fewer lines of code

**Interpreter System**:

- Code execution is immediate, allowing for quick prototyping

**Programming Paradigms**:

- Procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming

**Readable Code**:

- Influences from English and mathematics
- Uses new lines to complete commands instead of semicolons or parentheses

## Python Syntax

### Basic Syntax

- **Hello World Example**:

```python
print("Hello World")  # Output: Hello World
```

### Indentation

**Importance of Indentation**:

- Essential for defining code blocks (loops, functions, classes)
- Python will raise an error if the indentation is incorrect

**Example**:

```python
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
# Output: Five is greater than two!
```

**Consistent Indentation**:

- Must be consistent within the same block of code
- Commonly, 4 spaces are used, but at least 1 space is required
